    may
    sync through Mi Cloud or other apps (e.g. photos, contact lists), information in relation to creating an account and
    participating in the MIUI Forum or other FEIHUI platforms, phone numbers you insert into your contacts or to send a

    number of customers in certain demographic groups who purchased certain products or who carried out certain
    transactions. <br>
    For the avoidance of doubt, FEIHUI may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent if it
    is
    and only to the extent it is allowed explicitly under local data protection laws. Such disclosure may be brought
    about
    by the necessity to protect our rights, ensure the safety of you and other people, and comply with the requirements
    of
    the local government to facilitate the investigations of illegal activities.
</p>
<p>SECURITY SAFEGUARDS
</p>
<p>FEIHUI’S SECURITY MEASURES
</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access,
    disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to
    safeguard and secure the information we collect from your using of FEIHUI products and services and on FEIHUI
    websites.
    We will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information.
</p>
<p>For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification process for better
    security. When you send or receive data from your FEIHUI device to our servers, we make sure they are encrypted
    using
    Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") and other algorithms.
</p>
<p>All your personal information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We classify
    your
    data based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the highest security level.
    We
    make sure that our employees and Third Party Service Providers who access the information to help provide you with
    our
    products and services are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or
    terminated
    if they fail to meet such obligations. We have special access controls for cloud based data storage as well. All in
    all,
    we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security
    measures,
    to guard against any unauthorised access and use.
</p>
<p>We will take all practicable steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use
    of
    the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any
    personal
    information which is transferred from you or to you via the Internet.
</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO</p>

<p>● You can play your part in safeguarding your personal information by not disclosing your login password or account
    information to anybody unless such person is duly authorised by you. <br>
    ● FEIHUI cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accesses to your personal
    information
    as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must
    notify us
    immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of
    security. <br>
    ● Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.
</p>
<p>RETENTION POLICY
</p>
<p>Personal information will be held for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or
    as
    required or permitted by applicable laws. We shall cease to retain personal information, or remove the means by
    which
    the personal information can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that
    the
    purpose for which that personal information was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal
    information, including the cases when the personal information is no longer required for resolving legal disputes,
    applying our Agreements, or achieving our business goals.
